# Tor-Stem-JS
A Node package to interact with a Tor relay

# Note:
I'm just holding this repo until I have the free time to work on this project (Doing a cert right now). After that is over I'm excited to start working on this.

# What Is This?
A Node package that implements the <a href="https://stem.torproject.org/index.html">Stem API</a>. You can find the Tor Control Protocol Specification <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/control-spec.txt">here</a>.

# Why Does This Exist?
My website currently integrates directly with a Tor Middle Relay. I'd like to roll my own library to make that simpler and cleaner. Might as well make it availalbe when I'm done.
